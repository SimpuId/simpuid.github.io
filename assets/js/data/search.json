This site is hosted on Github Pages so the url is this If I find this task enjoyable, then I may shift it under a custom domainIt uses Jekyll to generate HTML pages from markdown source files.It uses the Chirpy theme developed by Cotes.I find this theme clean, functional and unbloated with animations (browsing on phone is possible). As a novice in frontend developement, a template theme seems like a suitable option to meThe markdown source code of all posts together with required Gem files can be found hereNotice the two branches in the repository. main hosts the source files and gh-pages hosts the actual site.Jekyll renders the markdown source code and the generated file is pushed to gh-pages branch.Everything is automated using Github Actions.
