I am starting this website to document things that I have been doing, I will do and for portfolio related tasks.

The first entry should be about the website itself (so meta). This site is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) so the url is [this](https://simpuid.github.io/)

It uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate HTML pages from markdown source files.

It uses the [Chirpy](https://chirpy.cotes.info/) theme developed by [Cotes](https://github.com/cotes2020).
I find this theme clean, functional and unbloated with animations (browsing on phone is possible).
> As a novice in frontend developement, a template theme seems like a suitable option to me

The markdown source code of all posts together with required `Gem` files can be found [here](https://github.com/simpuid/simpuid.github.io)
Notice the two branches in the repository. `main` hosts the source files and `gh-pages` hosts the actual site.

Jekyll renders the markdown source code and the generated file is pushed to `gh-pages` branch.
Everything is automated using Github Actions.
> Thanks [Cotes](https://github.com/cotes2020) for providing a template with preconfigured build scripts

I hope to find time and energy to maintain this website and improve my language skills to stop making these awkward posts.

Peace
